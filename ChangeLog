	* Release 0.60: 
	Subtly destructive bug in MIDI::_dump_quote fixed.
	
	MIDI::Event::copy_structure didn't work; fixed.
	
	%MIDI::note2number and %MIDI::note2number were named backwards --
	note2number actually mapped numbers to notes, and number2note
	mapped notes to numbers.  It made no sense, so I reversed it.

	Ditto patch2number and number2patch!  What was I thinking?

	Typos in %MIDI::note2number fixed.  All the A#'s were "A#" instead
	of "A#3" or whatever.  I also changed the "#" for sharp to "s",
	giving, e.g., "As3" instead of "A#3".  This gives a representation
	compatable with MIDI::Simple's notation.  But note that
	%MIDI::note2number doesn't contain all of the possible ways
	MIDI::Simple could let you represent a note -- just a
	(semi-quirky) subset of them.
	
	New module MIDI::Simple.
	
	Added MIDI::Event:: score subs, to support draw() and
	MIDI::Simple.
	
	Added MIDI::Opus::draw and supporting subs.

	* Release 0.61: Feh.  Forgot to re-comment out the debug code
	in MIDI::Simple
